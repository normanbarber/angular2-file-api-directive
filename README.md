# Angular2 File API Directive
This is a basic example of an Angular2 directive. I am using the HTML5 File API to choose a file and show a preview if the file type is an image. No bells and whistles, but the directive could be expanded to include more functionality like drag n drop. For this one I just want to start getting myself more familiar with the syntax and how to include directives since angular2 is now in beta.

##### Adding directive as an element from a template
```javascript
    > <fu></fu>
```

##### Running demo from command line
```javascript
    > gulp play
```
